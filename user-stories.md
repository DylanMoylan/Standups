Team member:
As a a member of a professional team or educational cohort, I want a space to be able to talk about my emotional journey and share my subjective experience of the workspace.

    -Each day, I can plot my 'emotional position' in the 'sine/rollercoaster graph' of daily life.

    -Each day, I can choose to briefly summarize the things I am feeling positive and negative about. (Or my accomplishments/setbacks). 

    -I can choose to share as myself, or submit my Standup as anonymous data to the collective.

    -As time progresses, I can review and visualize my own timeline in motion, and see how it compares and converges with collective sentiment (my team, as well as the anonymous masses using the app as a whole). 

    -I can view the whole team as a scatterpoint on one sine graph, or as an (anonymously compiled) word cloud if commonalities have emerged. 

    -I can choose to manage a todo list within the app, using the Sine graph as a pinboard for my tasks (broadcasting to others, or charting for my self how I feel about each task).

Team leader:
As a team leader, I want to view information about team moral over time and identify areas where I can be of assistance, or pinpoint areas of interest in the team's process (whether positive or negative). I want to provide an outlet for earnest discussion amongst the team within an inclusive space.

     -Each day, I can review data about the health and wellbeing of my group.

     -As team leader, I can optionally push questions (poll requests) or statements to the group each day to guide discussion. Response to said questions will never be mandatory.

    -As team leader, I can message team members individually about their progress

    -As team leader, I can moderate the group (deleting posts (from public view), removing and adding members, etc)


-As Supreme Commander, I can manage the structure of groups and sub-groups, and assign leaders to those groups.
